# Solar System Project

Student: Dewan Mahmud
Program: Per Scholas – Software Engineering (MERN Stack)
Cohort: 2025 – RTT 57

# Overview

This project explores JavaScript objects and arrays using data from the Solar System. It demonstrates how to create, access, and modify nested data structures representing planets, moons, and their physical properties. It also includes calculations such as planetary momentum and comparisons between celestial bodies.

# Files Included

index.js – Final working version of the Solar System code

original_code.js – Original version for reference and comparison

README.md – Project documentation

.gitignore – Git configuration to exclude unnecessary files

# Learning Objectives

Understand arrays and objects in JavaScript

Access and update nested properties with dot and bracket notation

Use conditionals and loops to explore data

Perform mathematical operations and comparisons

Log and display structured information in the console

Concepts Covered

Arrays and Objects

Conditional Statements (if, typeof)

Loops (for, forEach)

String and Number methods

Data validation and refactoring

# How to Run

Save all files in the same project folder.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the main file with the command:

node index.js


# View the results in the console.
(Open index.html in a browser and check the DevTools console.)

# Reflection

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript data structures. I practiced organizing information using objects and arrays, performing calculations, and improving code readability. It deepened my confidence in using logic and structure to represent real-world systems like the Solar System.
